# Markdown Files

Whether you write your book's content in Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or
in regular markdown files (`.md`), you'll write in the same flavor of markdown
called **MyST Markdown**.
This is a simple file to help you get started and show off some syntax.

For more about MyST, see [the MyST Markdown Overview](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html).

## Grading

The student is graded out of 100 points and 5 bonus will be available through in-class exercises. Letter grades will be assigned as per the table below.

|--------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| A+ (98-100)        | B+ (88-89.9) | C+ (78-78.9) | D (60-69.9) |
| A (93-97.9)        | B (83-87.9)  | C (73-77.9)  | F (0-59.9)  |
| A- (90-92.9)       | B- (80.82.9) | C- (70-72.9) |             |


Total grade is broken down as follows:

* Participation [25 pts.]
* Quizzes [25 pts.]
* Project [50 pts.]
* Bonus [2.5 pts.]

### Participation
At the end of each module, students will post a brief comment note of 200 words or less to any of the articles referenced in the [Outline](/outline.md). Therefore, students must identify a reading of their interest, go through it, and submit their note through the participation forum in iCollege. This approach uses the light touch to give undergraduate students some exposure to top-notch academic materials which are most often parts of graduate courses. Students will be awarded full credits for turning in the comments.

### Quizzes
Five quizzes will be issued during the semester and must be completed through iCollege (solutions will be posted in the [Schedule](/schedule.md) section of the website). Quizzes are open-book (i.e., consultation of web sources and class notes is allowed) and contain 10 questions each to be completed within 45 minutes. Please note that this is an extremely generous time allocation and expected time for completion is about half-an-hour. At the end of the course, quiz scores will be totaled up and curved if average class performance falls below the expected grade of B.<br>
Occasionally, students might encounter terminology which they are not really familiar with. That is why quizzes have been opened up for consultation of web sources and use of class notes. Policy analysts often grapple with domains that they have little knowledge of, but they are able to learn quickly and effectively.

### Project
Please refer to the [Project](/project.md) section for more information. The project consists of a policy report to be completed in teams of three to four. Each group member will be awarded the same grade, however students who wish to complain about their group collaboration are encouraged to voice their concerns as early as possible. Also, a "Fair Collaboration" clause ensures ongoing committment of all team members.

### Bonus
In-class exercise will be conducted in the same groups that will complete the group project. The team ranking first overall will be awarded 2.5 points at the end of the course (i.e., each group member will add 2.5 bonus points to her total grade). There might be more opportunities for bonus points throughout the semester.

## Policies

### Late Policy
Late work is not in the spirit of the class and is **wholeheartedly discouraged** but no late policy applies. Students who fail to meet deadlines must follow-up on their late submissions with an e-mail note providing a justification for the delay.

### Issues
Broader issues which affect student performance throughout the semester – including and not limited to disability, childcare, and mental health – must be notified to the instructor **at the beginning of the semester**. Late notifications of longstanding issues might not be a reason to waive any class requirements.

### Attendance
Class attendance is **required**. Students who experience personal or work-related issues might occasionally skip class meetings. When that happens, students are reponsible for sending out an e-mail note to the instructor and encouraged to attend office hours to make up for the material.

### Withdrawal
- Students wishing to withdraw within the official deadline as per the [Academic Calendar](https://registrar.gsu.edu/registration/semester-calendars-exam-schedules/#fall-2021) might do so without receiving a grade of F.
- Students wishing to withdraw past the official deadline might do so in accordance with the [Emergency Withdrawal](https://deanofstudents.gsu.edu/student-assistance/emergency-withdrawal/) policy.

### University
Standard university policies apply to this class. Students might read up on them at:

- [AYSPS Career Services & Student Life Office](https://career.aysps.gsu.edu)
- [Student Code of Conduct](https://codeofconduct.gsu.edu)
- [Policy on Academic Honesty](https://deanofstudents.gsu.edu/student-conductpolicy-on-academic-honesty/)
- [Disability Services](https://access.gsu.edu)
