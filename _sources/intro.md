## Grading

The student is graded out of 100 points and 5 more bonus points are available through in-class exercises. Letter grades are assigned as per the table below.

| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| A+ (98-100)          | B+ (88-89.9)   | C+ (78-78.9)   | D (60-69.9)   |
| A (93-97.9)          | B (83-87.9)    | C (73-77.9)    | F (0-59.9)    |
| A- (90-92.9)         | B- (80.82.9)   | C- (70-72.9)   |               |

Total grade is broken down as follows:

* Participation [15\%]
* Individual quizzes [40\%]
* Group mini-projects [40\%]
* Bonus [5\%]


### Participation
At the end of each module, students will post a brief comment note of 200 words or less about the content discussed in the module. Students who wish to further their expertise by looking up research articles that complement the reading assignments are welcomed to do so. Comment notes serve as a checkpoint for learning jointly with the quizzes.

### Quizzes
Quizzes will be issued after the end of each module and must be completed individually through iCollege (solutions will be posted in the [Outline](/outline.md) section of the website). Quizzes are open-book (i.e., consultation of web sources and class notes is allowed) and contain 10 questions each to be completed within 45 minutes. Please note that this is an extremely generous time allocation as students are expected to complete quizzes in abut half-an-hour. At the end of the course, quiz scores will be summed up, aggregated, and curved if average class performance falls below the expected grade of B.

### Mini-Projects
Three mini-projects to be carried out in groups of 3 to 4 are envisioned. The mini-projects are described at length in their dedicated pages and dates are available in the [Outline](/outline.md). Each group member will be awarded the same grade; however, students who wish to complain about group collaboration are encouraged to voice their concerns as early as possible.
 
### Bonus
There will be opportunities for bonus points during the class. Because attendance is required as per institutional policy, bonus points will become available during instructional time.

## Policies

### Late Policy
Late work is not in the spirit of the class. A 10\% grade deduction applies to students and groups who submit their work within 24 hours of a deadline, and a 30\% grade deduction applies to submissions coming in anytime after the 24-hour window. Note that the instructor is flexible to change due dates if there is consensus that students and groups might not have enough time to complete any assignment. 

### Issues
Broader issues which affect student performance throughout the class – including and not limited to disability, childcare, and mental health – must be notified to the instructor **at the beginning of the semester**. Late notification of longstanding issues might not be a reason to waive any class requirements.

### Attendance
Class attendance is **required**. Students who experience personal or work-related issues might occasionally skip class meetings. When that happens, students are responsible for sending out an e-mail note to the instructor and encouraged to attend office hours to make up for the material.

### Withdrawal
- Students wishing to withdraw within the official deadline as per the [Academic Calendar](https://registrar.gsu.edu/registration/semester-calendars-exam-schedules/#summer-2022) might do so without receiving a grade of F.
- Students wishing to withdraw past the official deadline might do so in accordance with the [Emergency Withdrawal](https://deanofstudents.gsu.edu/student-assistance/emergency-withdrawal/) policy.

### University
Standard university policies apply to this class. Students might read up on them at:

- [AYSPS Career Services & Student Life Office](https://career.aysps.gsu.edu)
- [Student Code of Conduct](https://codeofconduct.gsu.edu)
- [Policy on Academic Honesty](https://deanofstudents.gsu.edu/student-conductpolicy-on-academic-honesty/)
