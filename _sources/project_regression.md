# Project I

## Description

In this assignment, you will be using a publicly available dataset to study a statistical relationship between variables. We are interested in causal relationship, that is, the effect that one key independent variable has on the dependent variable. If your model fails to identify a causal effect, you will want to say why that is the case (e.g., omitted variable bias).

## Checklist
You will be turning in a toy research article which includes the sections below. Be concise and do not write more than three single-spaced pages (font size: 12). Figures and tables count towards the page limit. You will want to use Microsoft Word or any text editor (e.g., Pages) or markup language (e.g., LateX) for the write-up. Adherence to the [APA style guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org) is recommended.

- **Abstract** [10\%] around 150 words covering objective, methods, results, and conclusions.
- **Background** [25\%]: research question, literature review, policy relevance.
- **Methodology** [50\%]: causal model, regression model, description of variables, null hypothesis and/or expected results.
- **Results** [10\%]: regression output, conclusions.
- **Bibliography** [5\%].

## Structure
You will be turning in a brief report (2-3 pages) structured into three sections: [Background](#Background), [Methodology](#Methodology), and [Results](#Results). You should preface the report with an [Abstract](#Abstract). The content for each section is detailed below.

### Abstract
You will be writing an abstract including one or two sentences that cover:
- *Introduction*: outlines the study (e.g., bilingualism is a widely studied phenomenon).
- *Objective*: spells out the objective of the study (e.g., the objective of this study is to assess the financial benefits of bilingualism).
- *Methods*: sketches out the methods used in the article (e.g., the analytical model implements ordinary least square regression).
- *Results*: reports the main findings: (e.g., bilingualism does not significantly increase earnings).
- *Conclusions*: wraps up and discusses potential limitations (e.g., the study only looks at the US and findings might not generalize to other economies).

### Background
The background section should place the study within one or more bodies of literature and explain why we should care about the research question. As you articulate it (i.e., what is the effect of X on Y?), you will find yourself reaching to existing literature. You will not need to run any comprehensive literature review; however, you will need to show understanding that no research happens in a vacuum.  
One recommended approach is to identify the seminal references – usually a handful of articles – and then flesh out the topic relevance with a handful of more recent cites. You can use Google Scholar, and, if you really do not know where to start, you should join office hours. You will be evaluated on your ability to place the study within relevant research, not on the specific studies you reference. Spurious references are clearly a problem.  
A third important component of the Background section tackles the following questions: why does it matter? What are the potential policy implications of your findings? You must convince the reader that your topic matters to the research and policymaker community.

### Methodology
Write out a reduced-form model expressing the endogenous variable as a function of the exogenous characteristics you have identified in your causal model. Inclusion of some variables is theory-driven while some other variables are suggested for inclusion by the literature. The causal model is a high-level map of the relationships between your Xs and your Y and defines the antecedent, moderator, and mediator variables. Conversely, the empirical or reduced-form model operationalizes the causal model. Briefly outline the causal model (a visualization might help) and connect it with your empirical model.  
The discussion of the empirical model must *i*) include the regression method used for analysis (e.g., logistic regression, linear regression, etc.); *ii*) describe the predictors and parameters in the model with their coding (e.g., interval-level, categorical, binary, etc.); *iii*) state the null hypothesis(es) and/ or expectations. Clearly, the data source must be outlined before you start describing individual variables. If there are unobserved variables that bias the estimates, say it. For example, you might believe that unobserved ability positively correlates with educational attainments. In that case, the estimated relationship between education and wages is upwardly biased. Note that presenting biased estimates is not an issue; you only really lose points if the sources of bias, if any, are not (properly) identified.  
A null hypothesis is a research question framed through the falsification lingua: what are the conditions which would invalidate your hypothesis? You may believe that being a first-generation college student has no independent effect on college GPA, and that their negative correlation is spurious to the lack of financial resources. For your hypothesis not to test false, it must be that the conditional correlation of earnings and first-generation college status is statistically zero when accounting for financial resources.

### Discussion
Report and discuss the regression output. Reporting coefficient estimates is not sufficient; you will need to interpret them. Are estimated relationships statistically significant? Are they of substantial significance? What conclusions do they lead to regarding the null hypotheses? Do estimates match up with expectations?  
Conclude with summary remarks that tie back the results to the Introduction. How do the result fit into the literature? Do they uphold prior findings? What policy implications follow from your research? Do not forget to discuss potential limitations such as lack of generalizability, omitted variable bias, etc.

### Bibliography
The bibliography is really just one part of the Background section. As you introduce more articles, you will need to include them in your bibliography at the end of the manuscript. Format using the [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org).

## Fair Collaboration
Teams complement the submission with a note breaking down the individual contributions (e.g., student A did X; student B did Y, etc.). The note should also state that "each team member has contributed fairly to the group project" and must go in a footnote or in a *Collaboration* section at the end of the file. This will not count towards the word limit. If contribution has not been fair or balanced, this must be written in place of the fair collaboration clause.
Some students are better at writing and some other students are better at coding or at doing math. This is totally fine. What matters is that everyone contributes her fair share to the project, where the threshold for "fair" has to be agreed upon by the team members. If collaboration falls apart or some team members push the "fair" threshold a little bit too hard, teams should reach to the instructor immediately.
