## Description

In this assignment, you will be using a publicly available dataset to test a statistical relationship. While the preferred relationship is causal, it is fine to estimate models which are not causal in nature. One example of a model that would work fine is a wage model which identify the factors predicting earnings (e.g., age, experience, marital status, etc.).

## Checklist
You will be turning in a mini-research article which includes the section below. You will want to be concise and do not write more than about three single-spaced pages (font size: 12). Figures and tables count towards the page limit.

- **Abstract** [10%] around 150 words covering objective, methods, results, and conclusions.
- **Background** [25%]: research question, literature review, policy relevance.
- **Methodology** [50%]: causal model, regression model, estimation, description of variables, null hypothesis and/or expectations.
- **Results** [10%]: regression output, discussion, conslusions.
- **Bibliography** [5%].
You might write up in Microsoft Word or any other text editor (e.g., Pages) or markup language (e.g., LateX). Adherence to the [APA style guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org) is encouraged.

## Structure

You will be turning in a brief report (2-3 pages) structured in three sections: Background, Methodology, and Results. You should preface the report with an Abstract. The content expected for each section is the following:

### Abstract
You will be writing an abstract including one or two sentences covering:
- Introduction: outlines the study (e.g., bilingualism is widely studied phenomenon).
- Objective: introduces the objective of the study (e.g., the objective of this study is to assess the financial benefits of bilingualism).
- Methods: Sketches out the methods used (e.g., the analytical model implements ordinary least square regression).
- Results: reports the main finding(s): (e.g., bilingualism does not appear to significantly increase earnings).
- Conclusions: summarizes and include limitations (e.g., this study could not find any strong financial returns to bilingualism; however, the research only looks at the US and might not generalize to other economies).

### Background
The background section should place the study within one or more bodies of literature and explain why we should care about your research question. As you articulate your research question, whether it be causal (i.e., what is the effect of X on Y?) or predictive (i.e., what are the Xs that better predict Y?), you will find yourself reaching to prior studies. You will not need to comprehensively review the literature; however, you need to show understanding that research does not happen in a vacuum and builds up on prior contributions. One suggestion is to identify the seminal references first and bring the point home by referencing a couple or more of recent contributions. You can use Google Scholar to do that, and, if you really do not know where to start, you might want to join office hours. You will be evaluated on your high-level ability to place the study into the broader research context more so than on the specifics of the articles you reference.
A third important component of the Background section tackles the following questions: why is what you are researching on important? What are the potential policy implications of your findings? You must make a clear case that what you are writing about is something that matters to the research and policymaker community.

### Methodology
Write out a reduced-form model expressing the endogenous variable as a function of the exogenous characteristics you have identified in your causal model. Some of these variables will come to your from the reading of prior studies and some from your causal model. The causal or theoretical model is a high-level map of the relationships between the Xs and Y which defines antecentes, moderators, and mediators. The empirical or reduced-form model operationalizes the causal model. Briefly outline your causal model (a visualization might help here) and connect it seamlessy with your empirical model.
The discussion of the empirical model must include the regression method used for analysis (e.g., logistic regression, linear regression, etc.); *ii*) describe each predictor and parameter in the model with their coding (e.g., interval-level, categorical, binary, etc.); *iii*) state the null hypothesis(es) and/ or expectations. Clearly, the data source must be briefly outlined before you can start describing individual variables. If there are unobserved variables that bias estimates, state it. For example, if you believe that unobserved ability positively correlates with educational attainments, you will want to say that educational attainments estimates are upwardly biased in a wage model. Note that presenting biased estimates is not necessarily an issue: you will only really lose points if sources of bias, if any, are not identified.
As an example of null hypotheses, you might expect that work experience positively relates to earnings. A null hypothesis is a research question framed through the falsification lenses: which empirical findings would invalidate your working hypothesis? You may believe that being a first-generation college student has no independent effect on college GPA and that most of the observed (negative) effect depends on lack of financial resources. For your hypothesis not to test false, it must be that an achievement model which includes financial resources does not return a significant estimate on the first-generation college variable.

### Discussion
Report and discuss the regression output. Reporting coefficient estimates in the body of the text is not sufficient. You will need to interpret them. Are estimated relationships statistically significant? Are they of substantial significance? What conclusions do they lead to with regards to the null hypotheses and do estimates align with expectations?
Conclude with summary remarks that tie back the results to the Introduction. How do the result fit into the literature? Do they underpin prior studies? What policy implications follow? Do not forget to discuss potential limitations of your study such as lack of generalizability, omitted variable bias, etc.

### Bibliography
The bibliography is really just one part of the Background section. As you introduce more articles, you need to include them in your bibliography at the end of the manuscript. Format using [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org).
